			<h1>What is J-Gravity?</h1>
			<!-- Particle interaction  -->
				<p style="font-size:22px" >J-Gravity is a project to simulate the universe based off the Janus Cosmologial Model. The Janus Model states that there are two types of matter in the universe: Positive material and Negative material. Positive matter attracts positive, and negative attracts negative, while the two's interation is to repel one another.</p>

		<!-- The missing antimatter belong in a twin universe -->
		<div>
			<p>Matter and antimatter exist througout the universe. The collision of such two types of matter would result astronomical amounts of gamma rays as a result entire galaxies of such particles collided with each other (a galaxy made of matter and one with antimatter), then the aftermath of the annihiliations of the particles would send gamma rays throughout the entire universe. However, no such event has ever been observed. Thus, Jean Pierre Petit came up with the idea that a huge portion of the twin matter in the universe was missing. To be precise, in a twin universe.</p>

					<!-- Barne's Hut -->
					<h2>Barnes-Hut Algorithm</h2>
						<p>The goal of the Algorithms team is to find the most efficient way to compuete all of the data sets given as parameters. The algorithm used to divide the n-bodies is the Barne's Hut Algorithm. It seperates invididual clusters of stars and treats them as one mass compared to distant bodies.</p>

				<div>
					<h2>Octrees</h2>
						<p>the Barne's hut algorithm uses a tree data structure called an Octree. Octrees are often used to partition a three-dimensional space by recursively subdidving it into eight octants. For 3D graphics and engines, octrees are commonly utilized.</p>

					<h2>Lz4 Compression</h2>
					<p>Simulating millions of particles is awesome, but dealing with the amount of data in terms of Teraflops is not. Each "star" has properties of position in x, y, and z, as well as mass in terms of floats. To be able to manipulate such data, a lossless compression algorithm must be used in order to downsize the data set without losing any precision, or else one small loss in data results in huge problems later on in calculations.</p>

				<!-- Multithreading and Mutexes-->
				<h2>Semaphores, Multithreading, and Mutexes</h2>
				In computer architecture, multithreading is the ability of a central processing unit (CPU) or a single core in a multi-core processor to execute multiple processes or threads concurrently, appropriately supported by the operating system. In computer programming, a mutex (mutual exclusion object) is a program object that is created so that multiple program thread can take turns sharing the same resource, such as access to a file.
